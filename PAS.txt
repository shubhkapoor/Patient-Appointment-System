Database Design:

You'll need a database to store patient information, appointment details, and any associated notes. 
Consider entities like Patient, Appointment, and Payment.
Each patient should have a unique identifier and fields for basic information like name, mobile number, and email.
Appointments should be linked to patients and contain information like appointment date, time, notes, and a reference to any associated payment.

User Interface:

Create interfaces for users to interact with the system. This includes forms for adding patients and appointments, as well as a dashboard for viewing patients and their appointments.
Implement a search functionality on the dashboard to allow users to easily find patients by name.

Functionality Implementation:

Create Patient: Implement a form where users can input basic patient information and save it to the database.
List Patients: Develop a dashboard that displays a list of patients retrieved from the database.
Search Functionality: Enable users to search for patients by name, filtering the results dynamically.
View Patient: Create a detailed view for each patient, showing all their information and any linked appointments.
Create Appointment: Allow users to schedule appointments for patients, associating them with the respective patient in the database. Ensure that appointments are displayed on the patient's detail view.
Stripe Integration: Integrate with the Stripe API to generate payment links for each appointment. When creating an appointment, generate a unique payment link and store it in the database. Provide users with the ability to access these payment links when viewing appointments.

Stripe Integration:

Sign up for a test account with Stripe to get API keys for integrating payment functionality.
Implement logic to generate a payment link for each appointment using the Stripe API.
Store the generated payment link in the database along with the appointment details.
Testing and Deployment:

Thoroughly test the system to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
Deploy the system to a suitable environment, ensuring that it's secure and accessible to users.
Documentation and Support:

Provide comprehensive documentation for users and developers on how to use the system and its various functionalities.
Offer support channels for users to report issues and seek assistance.
By following these steps, you can develop a Patient Appointment System that meets the outlined requirements and integrates Stripe for payment processing.
